# 🚀 Arch & CachyOS Linux Setup Kit

A personal collection of scripts and configuration files for a fast, consistent post-installation setup on **Arch Linux** and **CachyOS**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Automated Installation:** Interactive scripts to install packages from the official repos and the AUR using either `paru` or `yay`.
- **🐧 Two Distros:** Separate `arch/` and `cachyOs/` kits with the same structure but distro-tuned package lists. See [`PACKAGE_DIFF.md`](PACKAGE_DIFF.md) for what differs and why.
- **🔧 Editable Package Lists:** All packages live in plain text files under each distro's `packages/` folder — add or remove a package by editing a single line, no scripting needed.
- **🐢 Optional GNOME Layer:** Packages tied to the GNOME desktop (shell, `gdm`, extensions, tweaks, `gnome-boxes`) are split into `packages/gnome.txt` and installed via a dedicated menu option — skip it entirely on a non-GNOME desktop. Generic GTK apps stay in `aur.txt`.
- **🎨 Post-Installation Configuration:** The shared `config/` directory holds drop-in configs for `fastfetch`, `starship`, and a working `.bashrc`.
- **🗂️ Organized Guides:** The shared `toolv2/` directory groups command references by topic for faster lookup.
- **📖 Manual Setup Guide:** Each distro folder ships a `manual_setup.txt` documenting every manual step, organized into numbered sections.

## 📝 How to Use

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bishwajit-2810/arch_setup
cd arch_setup
```

**2. Pick your distro folder**

```bash
cd arch        # on Arch Linux
# or
cd cachyOs     # on CachyOS
```

**3. Edit package lists** _(optional)_

Open any file under `packages/` and add or remove packages before running. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.

```text
packages/pacman.txt    — official repo packages
packages/aur.txt       — AUR packages
packages/gnome.txt     — GNOME desktop / extensions / GNOME apps
packages/uninstall.txt — packages to uninstall
```

**4. Make the script executable and run it**

Choose either `paru` or `yay` as your AUR helper:

```bash
chmod u+x setup_paru.sh && ./setup_paru.sh
# or
chmod u+x setup_yay.sh && ./setup_yay.sh
```

On Arch the AUR helper is installed automatically if missing. On CachyOS both `paru` and `yay` are already available from the repos / pre-installed.

**5. Follow the menu**

```text
1) Install official (pacman) packages
2) Install AUR packages
3) Install GNOME packages (desktop, extensions, GNOME apps)
4) Uninstall packages
5) Dry run (preview)
6) Exit
```

## 🆚 Arch vs CachyOS

The two kits share the same scripts and almost the same package lists. The differences exist because CachyOS:

- ships `paru`/`yay` pre-installed and enables the CachyOS + Chaotic-AUR binary repos by default;
- provides its own `cachyos-*` packages (keyring, mirrorlist, settings, kernel manager, `cachy-browser`, …);
- handles GPU drivers with `chwd` instead of `nvidia-inst`, and ranks mirrors with `cachyos-rate-mirrors`;
- defaults to the optimized `linux-cachyos` kernel.

Every added/removed package and the reasoning is documented in [`PACKAGE_DIFF.md`](PACKAGE_DIFF.md).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always run **option 4 (dry run)** first to preview all changes before applying them.
- The scripts require `sudo` privileges.
- Some packages need extra steps after install — check the distro's `manual_setup.txt` and the shared `toolv2/` references.
- **CachyOS:** never add `cachyos-*` meta packages to `uninstall.txt` — removing them breaks the curated setup.

**Happy Arching!** 😄
